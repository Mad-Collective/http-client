## Installation
Require the package as usual
```bash
composer require pluggit/http-client
```
To use [Guzzle](http://http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/overview.html) as a sender (the default option), you have to **require it manually** 
```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle "^6.0"
```
### Requirements
* `php >=5.5`
* `guzzlehttp/psr7 ^1.0`
* `psr/log ^1.0`

__*Note:*__ This package relies on the implementation of guzzle for the [PSR-7: HTTP message interfaces](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/)

### Additional requirements
#### Guzzle
The library allows to use different senders to execute requests; and adapter for `guzzlehttp/guzzle` it's included in the library **but  you must require the dependency manually**
```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle "^6.0"
```
### Optional requirements
#### Yaml parsing
If you want to use a Yaml file as a configuration source you can:
a) Use you own parser and pass the config as an array
b) Require `symfony/yaml` as dependency and pass the yaml filepath to the builder
```bash
composer require symfony/yaml "^3.1"
```
#### Logging
Do you want to know why your request is failing? No problem, the library accepts any [Psr-3 logger](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) logger implementation (like [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)) to write debug and error messages.

For a quick start you can use Symfony's console package to have debug messages in the console
```bash
composer require symfony/console "^3.1"
```
You will now be able to activate the console debug mode
```php
$builder->withConsoleDebug();
```
#### Pimple
If you use pimple for building your dependencies you can use the provider `Cmp\Http\Provider\HttpClientServiceProvider` to register the [builder](#configuring-the-builder) and the [multi client](#building-a-multi-client). 
```bash
composer require pimple/pimple "^3.0"
```
__*NOTE*:__ See the annex for how to register the provider

## Usage
The library allows to build requests from a set configuration values, execute them trough the client and get a response

### Defining a configuration
The configuration is what tells the client how to build the requests, let's see some examples of configuration
```yaml
my_users_api:
  endpoint: https://api.mysite.com
  headers:
    api_version: 1.2
  options:
    timeout: 2
  requests:
    list_users:
      path: /users
      options:
        timeout: 15
    get_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}
    create_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}
      headers: 
        - Content-Type: application/json
      method: POST
      
# Another service
the_comments_api:
  endpoint: http://messaging_service.com/v2/
  ...
```
The first line defines a name for a service, in this case `my_users_api`

__NOTE:__ You can see a full-fledged sample configuration file in `config-sample/requests.yaml` for working with a REST API

#### Service configuration values
* `endpoint` (**required**): This is the endpoint for the all the request for this service
* `headers`: A key-value array with the headers to add to *all* the requests for this service
* `query`: A key-value array with the query parameters to append in the URI of *all* the requests for this service
* `body`: A key-value array with the post parameters to send in the body of *all* the requests for this service
* `version`: HTTP protocol version, default one `1.1`
* `options`: A key-value array with options to pass to the http client sender to modify it's behaviour
* `requests`: A key-value array with the allowed requests for this service

#### Request configuration values
The request configuration allows the set almost the same options as the service configuration, overwriting the values provided for the service, this allows to define a general behaviour for a service but tweak some options for specific requests, like for example, allowing a longer timeout
* `path` (**required**): Defines the path that follows the endpoint
* `method`: Defines the HTTP method for the request. `GET` by default
* `headers`: A key-value array with the headers to add to this request
* `query`: A key-value array with the query parameters to append in the URI of this request
* `body`: A key-value array with the post parameters to send in the body of this request
* `version`: HTTP protocol version, default one `1.1`
* `options`: A key-value array with options to pass to the http client sender to modify it's behaviour

##### Underlying client options
The request options allows to customize the client behaviour without the library having to know specific details about how to handle them.

Taking the provided integration with [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/request-options.html) as examples, we could have:
* Basic auth: `auth: ['myUser', 'myPass']`
* Timeout: `timeout: 2`
* Connect timeout: `timeout: 15`
* Add a certificate: `['cert' => ['/path/server.pem', 'password']]`


#### Configuration placeholders
The library allows to indicate the presence of dynamic values in this configuration parameters as placeholders

##### Placeholder rules
* Placeholders are allowed in _path, query, headers_ and _body_ only
* Use this format to add a placeholder: `${PLACEHOLDER_NAME}`
* Placeholders tag names must be uppercase (although lowercase keys can be used when replacing them)
* You can have the same placeholder multiple times across all options, it will be replaced in all of them.

##### Replacing a placeholder in the request
To replace the placeholders, pass the values as paramters when creating the request 
```yaml
secure_api:
  endpoint: https://topsecret.com
  headers:
    api_key: MyPersonalApiKey
    token: ${TOKEN}
  requests:
    get_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}
```

```php
$request = $client->create('secure_api', 'get_user', [
    'token'   => $oath->sign($secret),
    'user_id' => $userId
]);
```

### Configuring the builder
The builder (`Cmp\Http\ClientBuilder`) is an object that will help you create you client, easing the customization process. This are the options available:
```php
$builder = ClientBuilder::create()
    ->withConfig($requests)
    ->withGuzzleSender($myCustomGuzzleClient)
    ->withConsoleDebug();
```
Once you've configured the builder you're ready to create clients for your http services

### Building the client
There are 2 different clients that allow to create and execute requests:
* `Cmp\Http\Client\MultiClientInterface`: This client has access to all services
* `Cmp\Http\Client\ServiceClientInterface`: This client can execute request from a single service only

__*NOTE*__: You _should_ try to inject always a `ServiceClientInterface` in your services, this will prevent sideeffects triggering requests from other services by mistake

The available methods in the clients are:
* `create`: Creates a request (`Cmp\Http\Message\Request`)
* `send`: Sends a request returning a `Cmp\Http\Message\Response`

They also provide some shortcuts to ease the use:
* `execute`: Creates and sends a request in a single call
* `json`: Creates and sends a request parsing a json response
* `jsonAsArray`: Creates and sends a request parsing as an array from a json response

#### Building a multi client
The easiest way to built the client is to use the method `build` on the builder
```php
$client = $builder->build();
```

#### Building a service client
To build a service client specify the name of the service when building the client in the last step of the builder
```php
$myServiceApi = $builder->build('my_service');
```

#### Customizing the builds
The client require 3 dependencies to work, the builder has methods to override all of them with custom implementations

##### Sender
This is the class that sends the requests, it has to implement the `Cmp\Http\Sender\SenderInterface` and return a Psr-7 compatible response

The builder will try to use the provided `Cmp\Http\Sender\GuzzleSender` by default, to specify a different one use:
```php
$builder->withSender($sender);
```
Even if you want to use guzzle, ou can also customize the internal client used
```php
// tweak the client
$customGuzzleClient = new Guzzlehttp\Guzzle();

// Pass it to the builder
$builder->withGuzzleSender($customGuzzleClient);
```

##### Config
This is the only required dependency, a configuration defining the available the requests
```php
$builder->withConfig($config);
```
If `symfony/yaml` is installed, you can pass a filepath with a yaml configuration
```php
$builder->withYamlConfig($yamlFile);
```

##### Logger
You can pass a `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` to receive debug and error messages
```php
$builder->withLogger($logger);
```
If you want to debug the raw http request/responses in the console you can activate the debug output in the builder (You'll need to have `symfony/console` installed)
```php
$builder->withConsoleDebug();
```

### Creating a request
To create a request you need to identify the service and the request that you want. Additionally you can pass dynamic values to substitute placeholders
```php
$request = $client->request('weather', 'forecast', ['city' => $city]);

// Service specific clients do not need the service name
$request = $weather->request('forecast', ['city' => $city]);
```

The requests created are `Cmp\Http\Message\Request` intances, implementing `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface`, making them suitable to share between libraries and frameworks

The library request object provides some helpers to work with them in an easier way:
* `withQueryParameter($key, $value)`: Allows you to add or modify a query parameter
* `withPost(array $params)`: Allows to pass a key-value array of params to send as body
* `withJsonPost(array $params)`: Allows to pass a key-value array of params; it will be codified as json and, the header `Content-Type: application/json` will be added
* `__toString()`: This makes the request embeddable in string

#### Customising the request creation
If you provide a request factory to the builder that complais with `Cmp\Http\RequestFactoryInterface`, you'll be able to extend the Request class and change the behaviour.  

You may ask _"hey, why would I like to do this for?"_  

For example to: 
* Change all outgoing endpoints to a dummy server to prevent to executed certain requests on test environments
* Apply a configuration to all requests from all services

```php
$factory = new TestEnvironmentsRequestFactory($config);
$builder->withRequestFactory($factory);
```

### Sending the request
After sending the request you'll receive a `Cmp\Http\Message\Response` instance compatible with `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`

This response object also provides some helper methods:
* `json($asArray = true)`: Parses the body as a json an returns either a `stdClass` object or an `array`
* `jsonAsArray()`: Same as before, but forcing the return type to be an array
* `__toString()`: This makes the response embeddable in string

### Exceptions
Not everything works as expected; to make your life easier handling this, the library provides a small set of exceptions:
* `Cmp\Http\Exception\RuntimeException`: This is the base exception used in the library, all the exceptions thrown within the library code uses or extends this one
* `Cmp\Http\Exception\RequestBuildException`: This exception is thrown when the process of building a request cannot be completed
* `Cmp\Http\Exception\RequestExecutionException`: This exception is thrown when some error happens sending the request

## REST API integration example
I'm going to show you how to perform the most common operation in a REST API.  
Lets imagine that we want to interact with an API endpoint to manage our application users.
The user entity looks like:
```javascript
{
  "id": "1",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

Now let's define the typical requests in our configuration file
```yaml
# Service definition
my_app:
  # The endpoint is required
  endpoint: https://api.myapp.com/v1
  options:
    auth: ['apikey', 'secret']

  # At least one request is required too
  requests:
    list_users:
      path: /users

    get_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}

    delete_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}
      method: DELETE

    put_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}
      method: PUT
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
      body:
        first_name: ${FIRST_NAME}
        last_name: ${LAST_NAME}

    create_user:
      path: /users
      method: POST
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
      body:
        first_name: ${FIRST_NAME}
        last_name: ${LAST_NAME}

    update_user:
      path: /users/${USER_ID}
      method: PATCH
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
      # body: No need to define all the body params here, we can do it at request time
```

### Building the API client
Let's build a service client for our api, as per the configuration, all the requests will include a basic authentication
```php
$api = $builder->build('my_app'); 
```

###List users
This call would return an array of users
```php
// We are going to modify the request to pass a limit on the number of users to retrieve
$users = $api->send($api->request('list_users')->withQueryParameter('limit', 25))->json();
```

### Get a user
This call will inject the user id in the path of the uri to request the user
```php
// The json shortcut creates, executes and parses the body response all in a single call
$users = $api->json('get_user', ['user_id => 1]);
```

### Create a user
Here we're going to replace the placeholders in the body array, if the api only accepts a json body, we have to add the correct content type header, like in the example so the request is created correctly
```php
$user = $api->json('create_user', ['name' => 'Jane', 'last_name' => 'Roe']);
```

### Replace a user
We can replace placeholders in both path or body params at the same time
```php
$user = $api->json('put_user', ['user_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Jane', 'last_name' => 'Roe']);
```

### Update a user
When we update some fields only, we don't known in advance what fields we are going to send, so it's better to decide later
```php
$request = $api->create('update_user', ['user_id' => 1]);
// Remember to assign the result, as the request return always a new instance when modifying it
$request = $request->withPost(['name' => 'Jane']);
$updatedUser = $api->send($request)->json();
```

### Delete a user
Deleting a user is even easier
```php
$api->execute('delete_user', ['user_id' => 1]);
```

## Annexes
### Pimple Service Provider
The library includes a service provider for Pimple to register a client in an easy way:
`Cmp\Http\Provider\HttpClientServiceProvider`
The provider will register the builder `Cmp\Http\ClientBuilder` object at key `http_client.builder` and a general purpouse multi-client `Cmp\Http\Client\MultiClient` in `http_client.client`, but it also accepts alias for both services

```php
$container->register(new HttpClientServiceProvider('requester', 'client'), [
    'http_client.yaml' => 'config/requests.yml',
]);
$builder = $container['requester']; // or http_client.builder
$client = $container['client'];     // or http_client.client
```

The options that the provider accepts are:
* `http_client.yaml`: A filepath with a ymal configuration file
* `http_client.config`: A configuration array with the requests
* `http_client.logger`: Pass a Psr\Logger\LoggerInterface object to add logging to the client
* `http_client.sender`: A custom implementation of the `Cmp\Http\Sender\SenderInterface` interface
* `http_client.guzzle`: A custom `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface` object (useful to keep a reference)
* `http_client.factory`: A custom `Cmp\Http\RequestFactoryInterface` implementation
* `http_client.debug`: Pass true and this will activate console output for debugging

---
### Development environment
To build the test environment you'll need docker and docker-compose installed:
```
make dev
```

#### Running the tests
```bash
make unit
make integration
```
You can run the tests only for a php version like this
```bash
make unit PHP_VERSION=5.6
make integration PHP_VERSION=5.6
```

#### Code-coverage
You can build a report for code coverage in HTML format. It will be available in `bin/code-coverage`
```bash
make code-coverage
```

#### Stop the environment
```
make nodev
```

#### Delete the environment
You can delete the docker images for a total clean-up
```bash
 make nodev IMAGES=true
```
